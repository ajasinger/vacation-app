# Vacation Quiz App

This React app is a quiz to help choose your next vacation destination. 

## Project Description

My goal with this project was to practice various React (??, hooks etc.)

I installed npx create-react-app to build from and ????? from there.

The ??? in wrote include: 


A few challenges I faced were: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
