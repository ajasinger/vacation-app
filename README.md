# Vacation Quiz App

This React app is a quiz to help choose your next vacation destination. 

## Project Description

My goal with this project was to practice various ?? in React including components, hooks ???

I installed npx create-react-app to build from and ????? from there.

The ??? in wrote include: 

### App Framework

The components are: 
1. A title
2. A questions component to hold all the multiple choice questions
3. Individual multiple choice question compnents
3. A results component 

## Project Challenges

A few challenges I faced were: 

### `export function`

I initally exported my functions using 
`export const QuestionsBlock = () => {
}`
but learned the the it must be exported  as a defualt function.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
